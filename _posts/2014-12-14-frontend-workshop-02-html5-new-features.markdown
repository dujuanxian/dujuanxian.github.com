After getting familiar with the [HTML5 new features][html5-new-features],
it is the time to start a game to refactor the legacy HTML4 page. Check the code [here](https://github.com/dujuanxian/art_gallery_html4).

The example is an art gallery site. Open the html4.html in your browser, and you will see it as following image.

It uses the old HTML4 tags and features, the task is to find them out and choose the right HTML5 features to replace them. See **[Tips][html5-new-features]**
if you get confused for choosing the features.

Check out the code for [HTML5 Demo](https://github.com/dujuanxian/art_gallery_html5).
