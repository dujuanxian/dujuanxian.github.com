###Why we need HTML5

####HTML5 Benefit
  - Semantic
  - Full CSS3 support
  - Local storage
  - Local DB
  - Audioï¼ŒVideo
  - 2D/3D graphics
  - [SEO][html5-and-its-seo-benefits]

Semantic web is designed to help machines understand more information on the page. It is also friendly to developers as
well -- you can get rid of `div` with the long classname everywhere.
HTML5 also provide new features to keep data in local storage and local DB, it won't be covered at this workshop.

###HTML5 Element
  - Doctype
  - Meta declaration
  - Script tag
  - Link tag

It is easier in HTML5 to define head tag or type.

####Doctype
{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
{% endhighlight %}

####Meta
{% highlight html %}
<meta charset="UTF-8">
{% endhighlight %}

####Script
{% highlight html %}
<script src="script.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

####Link
{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
{% endhighlight %}

###HTML5 Tag
`section` `header` `footer` `nav` `main` `aside` `article` `figure/figcaption` `time`

The definition and usages of tag usually can tell by its thematic meanings.

####**Section**
thematic grouping of content. The theme of each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the section element

####**Header**
introductory content for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A header typically contains a group of introductory or navigational aids.

####**Footer**
similar as Header. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.

####**Nav**
links to other pages or to parts within the page

####**Main**
to wrap the main content of the page, usually all content other than header and footer

####**Aside**
tangentially related to the content around the aside element, separate from that content

####**Article**
a complete, or self-contained, composition in a page and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable

####**Figure/figcaption**
a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single unit from main flow of the document
{% highlight html %}
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg">
  <figcaption>my image</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

####**Time**
{% highlight html %}
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2009-10-09">3 days ago</time>
{% endhighlight %}

###Tips

You may find sometimes it is really hard to choose tags, the most common one is `div` vs `section`. To distinguish the two, to read the definitions of them
is really useful, then remember the following tips.

####div & section
  - `div` has no semantic meaning, `section` does
  - `div` usually is used as a wrapper for styling
`section` help construct a document outline, usually contains a heading

####section & article
  - `section` forms part of something else, `article` is its own thing
  - A general rule is that `section` is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline

####aside
  - `aside` within `article`, `aside` should be related to that `article`
  - `aside` outside `article`, `aside` should be specifically related to `aside`

####header
  - don't overuse `header`, if your `header` element only contains a single heading element, leave out the `header`

####figure
  - not every image is `figure`, it is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document
  - `figure` can be more than an image
