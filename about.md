I am Juan, a Front-end developer at ThoughtWorks in Xi'an, China. Started a backend developer, Java leads me
to the programming world. Web development attracts me. But to make a page full of messy content is not enough.
I feel more interested in the front-end development. Luckily, the door opened and I started this board to draw
my world up.
